      "message": "My inclination would be to drop the first part sentence, because it is mentioned now in the introduction, and not relevant to \"unlocking\" and \"positioning\", and the second part of the sentence can be moved to the end of the paragraph. In that that way, if you follow the idea of a heading with \"Unlocking and Positioning...\", then the paragraph will follow that order.  That is, start with:  To unlock a toolbar, right-click...  and then add a sentence at the end -- based on the first of the current first sentence  in this paragraph.  Something like.  \n\n\"You can move an unlocked toolbar to a new docked position or make it a floating toolbar.\"  \n\nBut as you already know -- this \"floating toolbar\" explanation comes later....but maybe it is all right to collapse these two points about repositioning in a window and making a floating toolbar into a single section.  That is, drop the heading for \"floating toolbar\" -- because it is covered by a new heading about \"Positioning\" and \"floating\" is now explained in the introduction.  \n\nI do not have a particular suggestion -- just raising some variations for your consideration.  Sometimes too many subheadings splits up the functional actions  (given that this is a \"guide\" page).",
