      "message": "This technically looks logical, but IMO looses one important concept:\n\nDF in LibreOffice *should* be emphasized as \"not using styles\". This change makes styles \"secondary\" concept (just a group of DF combined together), which is technically correct, but conceptually wrong.\n\nI don\u0027t have a proposal how to make it better, other than maybe reverse the order of the paragraphs, like\n\n  \"A style is a set of formatting attributes ...\"\n  \"When you do not use styles, and apply formatting attributes to parts of text directly, this is called DF...\"",
