You understand it right, and that happens actually.\n\nIn contrast, when it recognizes other input as date, e.g. in my Russian locale, string like \"24 ноября 2020\", it does not try to find a similar format to the cell, and the resulting formatted output for me will look like \"24.11.20\".\n\nBut you noticed that that doesn\u0027t happen always. And you are right. Writer applies the new format only when the cell has not been formatted previously. Otherwise, it will keep cell format (even if it was applied by a previous automatic detection).",
