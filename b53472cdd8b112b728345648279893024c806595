For example, searching \"ScriptForge\", if you type letter by letter and see the results you\u0027ll notice that it will only show matches when you enter \"Script\" and then when you finish \"ScriptForge\". The in-between possibilities are not searched. Is it possible to enable partial word-matching?",
