      "message": "Ilmari... I ran a few tests here and it seems that FlexSearch is only searching for full words (not partial words). For example, searching \"ScriptForge\", if you type letter by letter and see the results you\u0027ll notice that it will only show matches when you enter \"Script\" and then when you finish \"ScriptForge\". The in-between possibilities are not searched. Is it possible to enable partial word-matching?",

      "message": "Checking with Olivier\u0027s preview it returns very few results. Many bookmarks that should appear do not. It appears to be inconsistent.\n\nOne search that popped up in previous discussion:\n\nSearch for \"color\" (without the quotes) returns only 8 matches, 7 for \"color\" and 1 for \"colors\" (with the letters [color] highlighted). Yet searching for \"colors\" returns 3 pages of matches.\n\nSearch for \"merge\" returned 1 match being \"mail merge\" in Writer.\n\nSearch for \"split\" would not return any matches for \"splitting\".\n\nWithout the fuzzy search we miss matches such as \"merging\" etc (searching for \"merge\").\n\nThere is no progressive matching, so typing \u003cm\u003e\u003ce\u003e\u003cr\u003e\u003cg\u003e will not show any results until the final \u003ce\u003e.\n\nIt would cause a deluge of bug reports if deployed in it\u0027s current state.",
