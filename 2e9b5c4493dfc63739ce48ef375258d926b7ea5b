A user with experience will not have trouble with the current description. I have tried to reword it for new users.\n\nI see two issues with the original description:\n\n1) The use of the word \"first\".\n\n2) The imputation that not selecting the option would cause numbering to start at 1.\n\nBoth have been avoided in the new wording while hopefully others have not been introduced in their place.",
