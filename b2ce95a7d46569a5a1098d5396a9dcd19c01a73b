      "message": "Reason I did this: From working recently on \"Text alternative\" (e.g., in Image Properties) -- became aware of the issue of \"assistive technologies\". Subsequently read that \"name\" may be used by assistive technologies. I have imagined here -- with zero knowledge -- that a screen reader will read \"Optimize Size\" and then mention the name \"Optimize Size\" -- so it seemed better to indicate that this was a link.  \n\nBut I guess we both are caught right now in the question: \"does it make a difference\"?  If we knew more about \"name\" in relation to assistive technologies, it would be easier to make a sensible decision.",
