      "message": "Hi Ming, I wonder if you have time to help me with the following.\n\n1. This patch makes corrections for the \"Vertical\" and \"by\" controls in the Position dialog (for shapes, images, frames, OLE objects).\n\n2. My request: I have only formulated this text from the point of view of LTR writing. Will it make sense in relation to \"vertical\" writing?  (I also think you work with translating the help to Chinese -- so this patch would affect the help as well).\n\nEven if you only look at one or two points (e.g., the ones where you think problems might arise), then this would be helpful.\n\n3. You can see the result (without the XML code) in an attachment to tdf#148486 -- or maybe you know how to use the XHP Editor.\n\n4. You do not have to check if the content is correct. This is addressed already in BZ. \n\nThanks.",
