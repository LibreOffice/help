      "message": "Hi Ming, I wonder if you have time to help me with the following.\n\n1. This patch makes corrections for the \"Vertical\" and \"by\" controls in the Position dialog (for shapes, images, frames, OLE objects).\n\n2. My request: I have only formulated this text from the point of view of LTR writing. Will it make sense in relation to \"vertical\" writing?  (I also think you work with translating the help to Chinese -- so this patch would affect the help as well).\n\nEven if you only look at one or two points (e.g., the ones where you think problems might arise), then this would be helpful.\n\n3. You can see the result (without the XML code) in an attachment to tdf#148486 -- or maybe you know how to use the XHP Editor.\n\n4. You do not have to check if the content is correct. This is addressed already in BZ. \n\nThanks.",

      "message": "Hi Seth,\n\nThanks for the review invitation.  It\u0027s great to see CJK users being remembered in such changes.\n\nI\u0027m not a heavy user of vertical text layout myself, so I\u0027ve just tested this position dialog for a shape in vertical text, and I found that for vertical, right-to-left layout (the traditional Chinese and Japanese layout), the position dialog automatically switch the \"Horizontal\" and \"Vertical\" lines with correct options, so that a user will first set the vertical position, among \"top/bottom/center/from top\" choices, then set the horizontal position.\n\nIn other words, the dialog and options work as a user of vertical text would expect and the work flow is natural.\n\nYour new descriptions in the help is good, with one caveat -- there is no \"reference line\" for vertical position in vertical text layout, just like there is no \"reference line\" for horizontal position in normal horizontal layout.  We only have reference line of text in the horizontal position options.  I still think the change from \"reference point\" to \"reference line\" is worthwhile, though, and maybe we can ignore the inconsistency for vertical text layout.  Or, if your \"reference line\" does not mean lines of text but means lines of the edges/borders, I\u0027d suggest using a different word.\n\nSo my opinion is that the change is good to go.\n\nI\u0027ve experienced a few other glitches in my testing, but that\u0027s beyond the scope of this documentation change, and I\u0027ll file bugs separately.\n\nMing",

      "message": "Hi Ming -- many thanks for taking the time to take a look and give feedback.  It is reassuring that there are not immediately obvious mistakes, and that, at least to start, the descriptions are meaningful in the vertical writing context.\n\n\"reference line\" -- only appears with \"to character\" anchor (and only if you choose a reference line in \"to\" (i.e., \"Character\" or \"Line of text\") and always with \"as character\" anchors (\"Baseline\", \"Character\", \"Row\").   iow -- possibly the context of choices in the dialog will make \"reference line\" meaningful.\n\nRegina mentioned that with \"To character\" anchor, the Vertical \"value From Top becomes From Right, but value From Bottom is not changed. That looks like a bug for me.\"  (....in case that is a \"glitch\" you encountered).\n\n(was unsure about your distinction between \"lines of text\" and \"edges/borders\" -- because for positioning purposes, it is necessary to have some \"edge\" to position in relation to.\n\nBut I am glad to hear that \"line\" is better than \"point\".  I made that change because in \"to character\" positioning -- because of the implementation -- you sometimes have to consider the entire line of text where the anchored character appears, not just edge/border of the character itself -- so it is useful/helpful (as user) to think of positioning in terms of lines in these situations.\n\nOk -- forward....if you later discover some problems -- you are welcome to send a comment to this BZ ticket.  Thanks again.",
