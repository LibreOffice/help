      "message": "I believe this needs some clarification - it would be confusing for most who do not meet wide/narrow characters daily (so for all except Asian users). Wide vs narrow characters - *IIUC* - are special forms of normal Latin alphabet (and maybe other Western alphabets, like Cyrillic/Greek?), that are shaped to fit a single Chinese character (wide), or two Western characters per one Chinese character (narrow) (again, this is IIUC - and I am confused by this, too). Single-byte vs double-byte tells not much, and in fact is misleading for Unicode - it comes from use of a *specific* codepage on MS systems in Asia, where those characters were encoded specifically - but current text this *looks* as if it converts between single-byte and UTF-16 encodings (which is not so).\n\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms",
