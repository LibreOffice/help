      "message": "No dispute with your description of entire paragraph area -- which is also how I have understood it -- even if I cannot say explain it in 7 comprehensible words or less right now --  Have been considering cases like:\n\n negative paragraph indents, where horizontal position \"to entire paragraph area\" is more limited than \"to paragraph text area\"\n\n so \"surrounding\" (in the everyday use of that word) does not fit all cases.  \n\nor\n\n a paragraph with a positive \"after text indent\" where \"to entire paragraph area\" is placed beyond the border of that paragraph. \n\n(yes, I understand why it behaves this way, but it is a case where, from a naive user POV (such as myself) -- it appears like \"Entire paragraph area\" is referring to \"where text could potentially be placed\" compared to the actual placement of the current paragraph text area.\n\n-- not defending the use of the word \"potential\" -- only illustrating a challenge in making a description that creates appropriate expectations when using the option.\n\nBesides -- \"potential\" fails in the case with \"above paragraph spacing\" where \"Top\" for \"Entire Paragraph Area\" is beyond \"Paragraph text area\" (but no text can be placed in the region between Paragraph border and Top of Paragraph area).
