      "message": "- agree that it was ambiguous, etc. - here is new attempt -- based on multiple experiments\n- For Y-M-D -- I am not sure this is correct.  Set your locale to French (Switzerland), enter 2-3-4.  According to the help (also before my editing), this should be converted.  When I try in LO7.1, I get \"text\"  (but 2020-3-4 is converted and formatted with ISO 8061)\n- For Y-M-D and YYYY-M-D.  Set your locale to Danish.  Enter 20-3-4  (it is converted to a date and displayed as 20-03-04).  Enter 2020-3-4 (it is also converted and displayed as 2020-03-04). (Looking at these cells with Table\u003eNumber Format, I can that the second is indicated as ISO, while the second is not).  \n\nMy questions:  \n\n1. Doesn\u0027t Y-M-D imply that text input with dashes should be converted (even if not part of the data acceptance patterns?  (but my French (Switzerland) example shows that this does not work)\n\n2. You objected to YYYY-M-D -- but I made that change because empirically, if you enter text with that pattern (see Danish example), then it is converted and formatted to ISO 8061",
