      "message": "- agree that it was ambiguous, etc. - here is new attempt -- based on multiple experiments\n- For Y-M-D -- I am not sure this is correct.  Set your locale to French (Switzerland), enter 2-3-4.  According to the help (also before my editing), this should be converted.  When I try in LO7.1, I get \"text\"  (but 2020-3-4 is converted and formatted with ISO 8061)\n- For Y-M-D and YYYY-M-D.  Set your locale to Danish.  Enter 20-3-4  (it is converted to a date and displayed as 20-03-04).  Enter 2020-3-4 (it is also converted and displayed as 2020-03-04). (Looking at these cells with Table\u003eNumber Format, I can that the second is indicated as ISO, while the second is not).  \n\nMy questions:  \n\n1. Doesn\u0027t Y-M-D imply that text input with dashes should be converted (even if not part of the data acceptance patterns?  (but my French (Switzerland) example shows that this does not work)\n\n2. You objected to YYYY-M-D -- but I made that change because empirically, if you enter text with that pattern (see Danish example), then it is converted and formatted to ISO 8061",

      "message": "Y-M-D implies that string with three numbers separated by dashes must be converted to ISO date. It works with 0-1-2, but it doesn\u0027t with 2-3-4. And that is an issue to ask Eike, orthogonal to this help page. The general idea is that such strings should be accepted as dates.\n\nYYYY-M-D is **NOT** a pattern. It MUST NOT be used here. Period. If you want, you are welcome to provide *samples* (like \"2020-1-2\") if you feel it worth (but it\u0027s not; and e.g., 201-11-2 is also recognized, but 20-11-2 is not; maybe it\u0027s all a subject for a bug).",

      "message": "OH! I never reached this point before.\n\nThis is wrong. Patterns and format codes are completely different, relate to different processed happening at different stages - I told that above. And the (unfortunate, but unavoidable) use of same codes in both is just a coincidence - Y in date acceptance pattern is not what is discussed in Format Codes.\n\nThat is the reason why I insist that you must not confuse users more, writing \"YYYY-M-D *pattern*\". The syntax for patterns is a different one, unrelated to syntax of format strings.",

      "message": "Thanks for clarification. I will drop this paragraph  (and also YYYY-M-D).\n\nWhere will a user find information about how to make valid patterns? (I searched in help, but did not find anything).  (Probably some of my mistakes here -- and your headache -- was that I did not appreciate enough that patterns and format codes are different).\n\nIf there is no existing help page about patterns, then I propose to elaborate the previous paragraph (about syntax) with some simple explanation of pattern construction.\n\nFrom experiments, here is a suggestion (guess!) for what should be mentioned:\n- A pattern must include at least two of the three items: D, M, Y with a separator between each item. It may also include all three, in any order.\n      \"items\" does not seem like a good word here.  What could be better?\n\n- . - : / , can be used as separators.  (maybe this is not exhaustive, but maybe covers 90% or more of the cases?)\n\n- Examples of patterns are:  D,Y ; Y-M ; M.D.Y\n\nI believe (hope) that this explanation would give users a reasonable chance to understand how to make patterns in the edit box.\n\n(IIUC, then the patterns are not so strict like the formatting codes, so\n1.2.20 and 01.02.20 would both be recognized by:  D.M.Y   and I can see, by experiment (with French (Switzerland) that I can input M.D.Y (3.25.45) and it will be converted and displayed according to the French Switzerland locale format (DD.MM.YY) 25.03.45)\n\nIn my experiments, I can see that the edit box has some \"validation\" , but I could get a pattern accepted like:  DtM  (but input \u00272t3\u0027 is not converted). But I am not trying to make a technical reference manual (i.e., document all the details of the implementation), or search for possible bug reports. I leave these issues to you and Eike.  If the simple explanations in the bullet points are clear and accurate for users, then I will make a new proposal.",
