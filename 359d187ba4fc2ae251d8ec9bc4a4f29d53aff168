      "message": "- agree that it was ambiguous, etc. - here is new attempt -- based on multiple experiments\n- For Y-M-D -- I am not sure this is correct.  Set your locale to French (Switzerland), enter 2-3-4.  According to the help (also before my editing), this should be converted.  When I try in LO7.1, I get \"text\"  (but 2020-3-4 is converted and formatted with ISO 8061)\n- For Y-M-D and YYYY-M-D.  Set your locale to Danish.  Enter 20-3-4  (it is converted to a date and displayed as 20-03-04).  Enter 2020-3-4 (it is also converted and displayed as 2020-03-04). (Looking at these cells with Table\u003eNumber Format, I can that the second is indicated as ISO, while the second is not).  \n\nMy questions:  \n\n1. Doesn\u0027t Y-M-D imply that text input with dashes should be converted (even if not part of the data acceptance patterns?  (but my French (Switzerland) example shows that this does not work)\n\n2. You objected to YYYY-M-D -- but I made that change because empirically, if you enter text with that pattern (see Danish example), then it is converted and formatted to ISO 8061",

      "message": "Y-M-D implies that string with three numbers separated by dashes must be converted to ISO date. It works with 0-1-2, but it doesn\u0027t with 2-3-4. And that is an issue to ask Eike, orthogonal to this help page. The general idea is that such strings should be accepted as dates.\n\nYYYY-M-D is **NOT** a pattern. It MUST NOT be used here. Period. If you want, you are welcome to provide *samples* (like \"2020-1-2\") if you feel it worth (but it\u0027s not; and e.g., 201-11-2 is also recognized, but 20-11-2 is not; maybe it\u0027s all a subject for a bug).",

      "message": "OH! I never reached this point before.\n\nThis is wrong. Patterns and format codes are completely different, relate to different processed happening at different stages - I told that above. And the (unfortunate, but unavoidable) use of same codes in both is just a coincidence - Y in date acceptance pattern is not what is discussed in Format Codes.\n\nThat is the reason why I insist that you must not confuse users more, writing \"YYYY-M-D *pattern*\". The syntax for patterns is a different one, unrelated to syntax of format strings.",
