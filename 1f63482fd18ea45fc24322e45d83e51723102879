      "message": "The commit message explains the situation. No special problems, but just in case you want to take a look...\n\nAlso one small question. I assume it is not possible to use an appl-\u003cswitch\u003e in the meta section. For example, in text/shared/02/06050000.xhp, the page title for Writer is:\n\n  \u003ctitle id\u003d\"tit\" xml-lang\u003d\"en-US\"\u003eDemote Outline Level\u003c/title\u003e\n\nbut this page is also used for Draw and Impress for the \"Demote\" command.\n\nafaik, there is no way to make one title for Writer and different titles (for Draw and Impress). \n\n(Not a big problem, but just curious if there is actually a \"right\" or \"better\" way to handle these situations.)
