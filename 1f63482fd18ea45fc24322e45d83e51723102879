      "message": "The commit message explains the situation. No special problems, but just in case you want to take a look...\n\nAlso one small question. I assume it is not possible to use an appl-\u003cswitch\u003e in the meta section. For example, in text/shared/02/06050000.xhp, the page title for Writer is:\n\n  \u003ctitle id\u003d\"tit\" xml-lang\u003d\"en-US\"\u003eDemote Outline Level\u003c/title\u003e\n\nbut this page is also used for Draw and Impress for the \"Demote\" command.\n\nafaik, there is no way to make one title for Writer and different titles (for Draw and Impress). \n\n(Not a big problem, but just curious if there is actually a \"right\" or \"better\" way to handle these situations.)

In these two cases, I was just updating the image information, which I assumed would not require a retranslation, so I left the \u003calt\u003e labels unchanged.  Avoiding retranslation was the only reason that I did not update the \u003calt\u003e labels in this case.  But now I will update them in the future.",
