I even don\u0027t know how to express this properly, but the idea is that one should \"break\" the sequence, allowing at least one number between the two buttons\u0027 \"tab order\": say, buttonA has tab order 0, buttonB has it 1, buttonC has 2 (they have contiguous sequence -\u003e they are in the same group); buttonD has 4 (not sequential after buttonC -\u003e starting a new group), buttonE has 5 (same group with buttonD)...\n\nand the tab order 3 may be unused in the dialog, or it may be assigned to some other control ...",
