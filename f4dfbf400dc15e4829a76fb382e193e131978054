      "message": "\u003e How would/can a user know if their device is on the denylist?\n\nI think a user generally does not need to know that.\n\n\u003e Or does the user simply require that Skia is used (without knowing if it is denied or not)?\n\nThe logic of the options is something like this: The user ideally shouldn\u0027t need to know, LO will use whatever is considered the best option. But since \u0027ideally\u0027 is not real world, the 2 options allow the turn off two possible sources of problems, 1) the Vulkan acceleration, which may be problematic because of driver problems, and 2) Skia itself, which may be problematic because at this point it\u0027s new. So the user shouldn\u0027t need to know, unless troubleshooting.\n\n\u003e Do you think there is any need to mention Vulkan?  I assume it is used (automatically) if \"force Skia software rendering\" is not chosen.\n\nI think users do not even know what Vulkan is, let alone care.\n \n\u003e Do you know why a user might want to \"force\" Skia?  (maybe this could be mentioned in the help).\n\nI have removed the \"force\" UI option, as I think that\u0027s just asking for trouble. It\u0027s now only available as an expert option, for people who actually know what they are doing, and those by definition should know what they are doing. Those who do not are better off not having an easy way to mess things up.",
