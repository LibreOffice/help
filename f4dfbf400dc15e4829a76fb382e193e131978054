Or does the user simply require that Skia is used (without knowing if it is denied or not)?\n\nDo you think there is any need to mention Vulkan?  I assume it is used (automatically) if \"force Skia software rendering\" is not chosen.\n\nDo you know why a user might want to \"force\" Skia?  (maybe this could be mentioned in the help).",
