It might be even not applicable to other systems if those do not impose such restriction, and generally is never a problem outside of Windows. We even only show the architecture tip in the \"JRE missing\" dialog for Windows, not for other OSes (see https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d115002).",
