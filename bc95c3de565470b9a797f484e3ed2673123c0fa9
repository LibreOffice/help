      "message": "Hi Rafael,\n\nI\u0027m finding it difficult to effectively review this change because I would need to see it \"in action\" rather than just reading the XHP code. I\u0027ve never built the full help system, and haven\u0027t really got time to learn how to do so at present. Would it be possible to ask Olivier to review?\n\nPoints that I have noticed:\n(1) In the trunc section of 04060106, should the name attribute of the link tag be updated to \"trunc_link\"?\n(2) In the Syntax section of func_truc, the name of the function is incorrect.\n(3) In the Syntax section of func_rounddown, there is a note about how LO ensures interoperability with Excel. This may be correct (I haven\u0027t checked) but is it important enough for the Help, given that we already state that the default value for this argument is 0? I would suspect not but if it is retained, should it also be present for trunc?\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve\n",
