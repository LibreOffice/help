I got the impression from a recent exchange with Olivier (when I was asking about using icons \"inline\"), that in this kind of situation, he liked to have a \"label\" with the icon -- so when I sent the table, I was imagining:\n\n\u003clistitem\u003e\n\u003cparagraph xml-lang\u003d\"en-US\" id\u003d\"par_id3145345\" role\u003d\"listitem\"\u003eOn the Form Controls toolbar, click the \u003cemph\u003ePush Button\u003c/emph\u003e icon.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\n\n(Table Here -- so it would appear like:  (graphic)   Pushbutton icon  )\n\n(mouse paragraph here)\n\u003c/listitem\u003e\n\n(so -- even if I do not have an opinion -- maybe it is good to \"follow the crowd\" in this case.
