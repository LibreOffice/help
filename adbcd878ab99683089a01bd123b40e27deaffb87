      "message": "I\u0027m not sure, if the mouse pointer should be described in such an exact way. It does look like a hand with pointing finger with every backend I tested (didn\u0027t test macOS), but maybe it can appear as something different in the future.\nAlso, would it be better to say \"Click and drag the view to the desired position\"? Just to avoid any misconception that you are somehow moving the page itself.",

      "message": "- Good point about pointer appearance.  Seemed relevant to mention (generally) the change in mouse pointer (because when View - Shift is selected, nothing seems to happen). (also UI in menu does not give any indication). \n- Seemed better to refer to page and not view, because the Draw canvas is called a \"page\" (e.g., Page \u003e New Page) (and meaning of \"view\" is not clear), but moved \"page\" to become the object of \"click\", which might help clarify.",
