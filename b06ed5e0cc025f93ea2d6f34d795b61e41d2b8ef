(e.g., Distribute Columns Evenly, Optimal Row Height, etc.).\n\nNeed some advice about where to place the \"Howtoget\" sequences for these commands.\n\nsource/text/swriter/00/00000405.xhp  has the relevant icon tables, and there is some overlap with Writer and Draw.  \n\nI could not find anything in /shared/ for \"Format - Table ... \" (which is the Draw/Impress version of Table - Size ...) -- perhaps the closest would be something like, shared/00/00040500.xhp, which has Format commands, but nothing for \"Table\".\n\nIs it all right to put switches for Draw as part of the /swriter...file?  \n\nOr how should I handle it?\n\n\n\n",
