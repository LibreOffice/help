      "message": "Thanks for feedback Mike -- did you also read the next paragraph?  \n\nThe logic is:  first describe what the feature does (i.e., this paragraph).  Then (next paragraph) explain how to use the \"AutoInclude\" feature. then (third paragraph) clarify the conditions for when it is likely to be relevant to use).",
