      "message": "Are you aware what merging a patch with string changes of a size like this a few days before the string freeze (planned for week July 4 - 11) means for the l10n community and the quality of l10n QA process?\n\nThis patch (and others for the ScriptForge library delivered in the last 24 hours) create a big number of fuzzy and untranslated strings in LO74 help just days before the RC1 release thus making the phase of polishing and testing translations with RC\u0027s not possible ...\n\nAfter patching the file /helpcontent2/source/text/sbasic/shared/03.po is solely labeled with *176* fuzzy strings and *150* new untranslated strings. Since this is not an easy topic to translate (very technical) the translation of will probably mean most teams will not meet the deadline of the release date of RC1 ...\n\nThe l10n teams will have to hurry translating this big set of strings instead of having a test of release candidates with their finished translations in the following week ...",

      "message": "Martin: please consider that the audience for this topic is small. I don\u0027t understand this aggressive attitude related to translations. When I do translations as a volunteer, I view them as \"nice to have\" because I have no responsibility or deadlines. I\u0027ve never felt the need to express myself in an angry way because new content appeared for translation.",

We do not plan to submit any more patches for the 7.4 release.\n\nSince these new services of the ScriptForge library will be available in LO 7.4, I think it is important to have these strings in the 7.4 release.",
