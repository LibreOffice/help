(could not find this information mentioned elsewhere in the help pages).  (there is a mention in a note in https://help.libreoffice.org/7.4/en-US/text/swriter/guide/sections.html, but \"click in front or behind the section\" does not explain well.)\n\nMaybe there are comments about the formatting or description in this patch?",
