      "message": "Current text reads \"Type Lists the available field types\". You write \"Type lists the available document fields\".\n\nDo I understand it correctly that the problem for you arises from the ability to change the field later, to show a different data? I don\u0027t understand why is that a problem actually...\n\nFrom user PoV, Type is just a grouping for several related pieces of information, and Select is the specific piece of information. So they two (Type+Select) define which piece of information will get shown in this place.\n\nThe fact that later you can change the \"Select\" in the already inserted field, but can\u0027t change the \"Type\", is just a random implementation decision, and is not something fundamentally necessary: it\u0027s possible to re-implement the edit dialog to provide a choice in Type, and allow to re-define already inserted field to a different type, too (making it effectively identical to Insert Field dialog). Or to make Select read-only...\n\nSo I don\u0027t know which problem you try to solve here. Assuming thet I\u0027m right in my understanding: my opinion is, that instead of trying to invent some concept here, which would \"explain\" to user why something is editable, and something is not, you may create a better explanation of what the Type and Select actually do, and just limit yourself to stating that one is later nor editable, while the other is editable, without trying to provide a rationale for an arbitrary design decision.",
