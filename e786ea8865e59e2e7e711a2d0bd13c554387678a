      "message": "1) Replacing text with embedvar will trigger a translation of a paragraph, and will appear at the translator screen to translate an untranslatable tag. A useless demand for review.\n\n2) the content of \u003cembedvar\u003e is defined just above. As this is an advise to user, better rephrase and put as a \u003cnote\u003e, wrapped in a \u003csection\u003e and \u003cembed\u003e in other places.\n\n3) for the sake of clarity, refrain to over-use \u003cembed\u003es inside a paragraph, as it will get hard to maintain in the future. Savings here are minimal.",
