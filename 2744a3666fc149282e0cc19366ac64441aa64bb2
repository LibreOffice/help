      "message": "I strongly disagree with this word. The \"ignored\" is totally ambiguous: I suppose that you imply that \"there was some original area, and after that, the indents shifted text to more inner area, but here we ignore that shift, and consider original outer areas\"; but just as well, reading the \"ignored\", one may think \"there is text, and also surrounding indents - but those surrounding areas are ignored, and only text is taken into account\". This completely depends on your mental model; and the wording must not depend on that, but instead must be specific enough to *build* adequate mental model.\n\nMy proposal would be: \"Any indents, padding or borders of the paragraph are part of the entire paragraph area.\"",
