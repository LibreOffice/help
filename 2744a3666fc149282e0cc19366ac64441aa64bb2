      "message": "Thanks for interesting suggestions Mike. Seems like we are getting closer...\n\nThree first reactions...\n\n1. Maybe ok to keep \"Entire...\" which keeps a parallel with \"Entire page\", \"Entire frame\" (both which have their own \"page/frame text area\")\n -- or drop the \"Entire\" for all (to reduce text in dropdown box). (no strong opinion for now)\n\n2. as you imply, may need slightly different descriptions for horizontal and vertical (i.e., not possible to simply embed one into the other).\n\n3. Also as you suggest probably need to consider \"paragraph text area\" (PTA) at the same time as EPA (Entire Paragraph Area)\n\nWill work further with the suggestions....\n\nMeanwhile...another idea about how to understand (conceptualize) the task.\n\nafaict, the issue here is to define the boundary of EPA.\n\nThe answer is:  The ”container” of the paragraph is the EPA .\n\n(stated for now in idiosyncratic/imprecise language – primarily to check that the conception works.)\n\nContext:                   Container (i.e., boundary)\nsingle-column              page  margins\nmulticolumn                column edges\ntable cell                 cell borders/edges\nframe                      frame borders/edges\nsection                    sections/border\n(others?)\n  columns in frames        column edges\n  columns in sections      column edges\n  \n\nIn short: The EPA is the border of the paragraph container.\n\nMaybe \"container\" is what you have called \"parent area\"? \n\nWith this answer: (a) don’t need to know about text areas, padding, indents, etc.; (b) any understanding of paragraph is sufficient here, i.e., don’t need a precise definition, (c) idea of \"container\" (or however to say it) may be relatively easy to explain and to understand, and (d) accurate (if this analysis holds), especially in the sense of supporting a user to from an adequate mental model.",

The \"ignored\" is totally ambiguous: I suppose that you imply that \"there was some original area, and after that, the indents shifted text to more inner area, but here we ignore that shift, and consider original outer areas\"; but just as well, reading the \"ignored\", one may think \"there is text, and also surrounding indents - but those surrounding areas are ignored, and only text is taken into account\".

      "message": "Skipping over the assumptions and “musts” for now – and taking the concrete proposals we have in hand (and adding back the first part of the paragraph), namely:\n\n “the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed.”\n\nAt the very least – from this sentence, a user should be able to grasp the idea that the positioning is in relation to paragraph where the anchor is located.  (No assumptions made about how the user understands the meaning of “paragraph”).\n\nIn principle, we could stop there.\nWhy add more information? \n\nPresumably because we believe that while “paragraph” (however understood) is enough to point in the right direction, it is not likely to have sufficient constraints to address likely ambiguities and/or potential surprises (in relation to “entire paragraph area”) — which motivates the attempt to give additional information to better constrain expectations of how to position in relation to “Entire paragraph area”.\n\nEvaluating the two concrete proposals from that point of view (“additional constraints on expectations”):\n\n Proposal 1: the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed. Any indents, padding or borders of the paragraph are part of the entire paragraph area.\n\nSome of the problems with this proposal:\n    1. indents, padding and borders are identified as part of the paragraph area, but implies that there must be other parts, which are?\n    2. If the answer is “the paragraph”, then what is the meaning of “paragraph” in this context?, especially when the previous sentence says that “the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph”?\n    3. The statement is false in relation to negative indents, which are not part of the “entire paragraph area\".\n\n Proposal 2: the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed. Any indent, padding or border applied to the selected paragraph does not affect the size of the entire paragraph area.\" \n\nEvaluation:\n    1. this proposal takes care of “negative indents”\n    2. I agree that this proposal does not say what is the “entire paragraph area”, which is partly what motivated adding the sentence about using the area color.\n    3. The point in mentioning that indent, padding, and border are not relevant to entire paragraph area is exactly in the spirit of constraining expectations about what is relevant (and in the direction of “wording must...must be specific enough to *build* adequate mental model.”) \n    4. This proposal only uses the word “paragraph” in relation to the selection (i.e., not depending on having to explain the meaning of paragraph here – a good thing imo).\n    5. Possibly the word “size” is not good enough.   \n       Positioning is in relation to the “region”. The issue is “where is the boundary” of the region – so that options like “Top”, “Center” and “Bottom” get a definite meaning. \n       Probably I chose “size” to indicate that any formatting done to the paragraph (in an everyday meaning, or maybe even in the LO meaning, in that the Paragraph dialog acts on “the paragraph”) is not relevant for understanding the borders of “Entire Paragraph area”. Will think further to see if that can be improved…\n       \nBetween these two proposals, I would still choose Proposal 2. \nBut maybe a third proposal is waiting to be discovered...",
