      "message": "I strongly disagree with this word. The \"ignored\" is totally ambiguous: I suppose that you imply that \"there was some original area, and after that, the indents shifted text to more inner area, but here we ignore that shift, and consider original outer areas\"; but just as well, reading the \"ignored\", one may think \"there is text, and also surrounding indents - but those surrounding areas are ignored, and only text is taken into account\". This completely depends on your mental model; and the wording must not depend on that, but instead must be specific enough to *build* adequate mental model.\n\nMy proposal would be: \"Any indents, padding or borders of the paragraph are part of the entire paragraph area.\"",

But we must not rely on such initial assumption: we must provide a description that simply lists all components of the area statically, without any \"dynamics\".",

      "message": "Skipping over the assumptions and “musts” for now – and taking the concrete proposals we have in hand (and adding back the first part of the paragraph), namely:\n\n “the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed.”\n\nAt the very least – from this sentence, a user should be able to grasp the idea that the positioning is in relation to paragraph where the anchor is located.  (No assumptions made about how the user understands the meaning of “paragraph”).\n\nIn principle, we could stop there.\nWhy add more information? \n\nPresumably because we believe that while “paragraph” (however understood) is enough to point in the right direction, it is not likely to have sufficient constraints to address likely ambiguities and/or potential surprises (in relation to “entire paragraph area”) — which motivates the attempt to give additional information to better constrain expectations of how to position in relation to “Entire paragraph area”.\n\nEvaluating the two concrete proposals from that point of view (“additional constraints on expectations”):\n\n Proposal 1: the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed. Any indents, padding or borders of the paragraph are part of the entire paragraph area.\n\nSome of the problems with this proposal:\n    1. indents, padding and borders are identified as part of the paragraph area, but implies that there must be other parts, which are?\n    2. If the answer is “the paragraph”, then what is the meaning of “paragraph” in this context?, especially when the previous sentence says that “the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph”?\n    3. The statement is false in relation to negative indents, which are not part of the “entire paragraph area\".\n\n Proposal 2: the object is positioned in relation to the paragraph where the anchor is placed. Any indent, padding or border applied to the selected paragraph does not affect the size of the entire paragraph area.\" \n\nEvaluation:\n    1. this proposal takes care of “negative indents”\n    2. I agree that this proposal does not say what is the “entire paragraph area”, which is partly what motivated adding the sentence about using the area color.\n    3. The point in mentioning that indent, padding, and border are not relevant to entire paragraph area is exactly in the spirit of constraining expectations about what is relevant (and in the direction of “wording must...must be specific enough to *build* adequate mental model.”) \n    4. This proposal only uses the word “paragraph” in relation to the selection (i.e., not depending on having to explain the meaning of paragraph here – a good thing imo).\n    5. Possibly the word “size” is not good enough.   \n       Positioning is in relation to the “region”. The issue is “where is the boundary” of the region – so that options like “Top”, “Center” and “Bottom” get a definite meaning. \n       Probably I chose “size” to indicate that any formatting done to the paragraph (in an everyday meaning, or maybe even in the LO meaning, in that the Paragraph dialog acts on “the paragraph”) is not relevant for understanding the borders of “Entire Paragraph area”. Will think further to see if that can be improved…\n       \nBetween these two proposals, I would still choose Proposal 2. \nBut maybe a third proposal is waiting to be discovered...",
