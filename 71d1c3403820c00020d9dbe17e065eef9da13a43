      "message": "Hi Eike,\n\nMany thanks for that, I understand the point you are making.\n\nIn my opinion, the 7.2 help description of this function is not user-friendly or helpful. It doesn’t provide enough explanation about what the function does in Calc’s initial configuration (with no changes to main.xcd). Nor does it give any clue as to how a user might modify the so-called “list in the configuration” to cater for arbitrary conversions.\n\nI think I am unclear as to the primary purpose of the function - do we want to describe it as a general-purpose conversion function? If so, then we should consider:\n(a) How many of our users will be prepared and competent to search for and edit the XML in main.xcd?\n(b) Do we currently describe anywhere the process of editing main.xcd?\n(c) Presumably editing main.xcd will adversely affect portability – a spreadsheet will only act as expected on an installation that contains a compatible main.xcd.\n(d) Presumably the edited main.xcd will be lost next time LO is updated.\n\nOf course we can clarify much of this on the wiki at https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Calc_Functions/CONVERT_OOO.\n\nI’d welcome your further thoughts on these points before we proceed further.\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve",

But advising to use EUROCONVERT() instead of the currency conversions provided with CONVERT_OOO() is good. CONVERT() does not provide conversions CONVERT_OOO() would have, unless users added such factors to the configuration.\n\n\n\u003e Users touching main.xcd is a time bomb for costly calls to Help Desk.\n\nIt was never meant to have users modify main.xcd (conversion factors could be added to registrymodifications.xcu instead, like with all configuration changes). Back in the days it was introduced even as a separate file that could be rewritten, but nowadays that way the configuration mechanism allows enterprises to maintain conversion factors centrally in the admin configuration, it could even be updated on a regular basis to provide arbitrary currency exchange rates, product prices or whatever one would think of. It wasn\u0027t meant for end users. But I also doubt the feature got wider adopted in the wild.",
