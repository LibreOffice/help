      "message": "Hi Eike,\n\nMany thanks for that, I understand the point you are making.\n\nIn my opinion, the 7.2 help description of this function is not user-friendly or helpful. It doesn’t provide enough explanation about what the function does in Calc’s initial configuration (with no changes to main.xcd). Nor does it give any clue as to how a user might modify the so-called “list in the configuration” to cater for arbitrary conversions.\n\nI think I am unclear as to the primary purpose of the function - do we want to describe it as a general-purpose conversion function? If so, then we should consider:\n(a) How many of our users will be prepared and competent to search for and edit the XML in main.xcd?\n(b) Do we currently describe anywhere the process of editing main.xcd?\n(c) Presumably editing main.xcd will adversely affect portability – a spreadsheet will only act as expected on an installation that contains a compatible main.xcd.\n(d) Presumably the edited main.xcd will be lost next time LO is updated.\n\nOf course we can clarify much of this on the wiki at https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Calc_Functions/CONVERT_OOO.\n\nI’d welcome your further thoughts on these points before we proceed further.\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve",
