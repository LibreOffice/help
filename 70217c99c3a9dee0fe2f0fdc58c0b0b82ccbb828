I may be tempted to pass a reference to a date cell and get an error.\nThe dates are passed as strings if they are entered directly into the formula. They can also be passed as references. I added a new sentence in line 171 to explain that.\n\n\u003e If the date is not locale dependent, what is the date format to use?\nThe dates are localized; However, which weekday that is considered the first day of the week is not localized. Some locales use Sunday as the first day of the week, but the WEEKS function always users Monday.",
