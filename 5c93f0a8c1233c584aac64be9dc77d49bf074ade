      "message": "Don\u0027t understand what you mean with circumstances that trigger it. Any case of an empty translatable paragraph triggers the problem. You can run \"make translations\" (after make l10ntools.all) to see those errors.\n\nIf you need an paragraph for xml/structure reasons, it should be flagged as not-to-be-translated with localize\u003d\"false\" attribute. But in lots of cases there doesn\u0027t seem to be the need for those empty paragraphs in the first place.\n\nEllipsis or any content will also work, but that of course depends on why the empty paragraph was added in the first place (again I saw many cases where it seems completely unnecessary). Not sure whether single ellispis is worth translating, so might also be better with localize\u003d\"false\" (but not sure, maybe some languages want to translate/use different characters)",
