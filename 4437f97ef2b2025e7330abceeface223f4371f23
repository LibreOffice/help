It was merely a matter of telling FlexSearch to tokenise fully.\n\nI also forgot to raise the limit of search results as the default is 100. I now set it to 1000 - do you think this is too much?\n\nI tested now with ru and zh-CN languages and they seem to work.\n\nSearching with multiple strings also works as expected.",
