      "message": "I don\u0027t think that mentioning the space preceding the minus is needed - especially since that looks to be a bug (or at least an overlook; VBA adds a space before positives, and minus instead of space for negatives - and the space is *definitely* intended for aligning negative and positive numbers, and having the space before minus works against that goal).",

      "message": "Mike, indeed this looks like an bug to me. I took a look at the actual code and the blank space is added explicitly when \"Option Compatible\" is disabled (regardless of being negative/positive). See:\nhttps://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/basic/source/runtime/methods.cxx?r\u003dfffc6b40#1476\n\nFor this Help patch, I\u0027ll remove this part of the text. I\u0027ll also file a separate bug report on this unexpected behavior.",
