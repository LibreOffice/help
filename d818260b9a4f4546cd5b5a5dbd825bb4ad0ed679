      "message": "Form Control is OK to delete, because it moved to its own top level menu \"Form\". However, Script still exists in Insert, but you only see it, if you do File - New - HTML Document or I guess if you open an existing HTML file.\nThe main description for Script is misleading, though: \"Inserts a script at the current cursor position in an HTML or text document.\" Clearly \"or text document\" should be removed. The file to edit is source/text/swriter/01/04200000.xhp",

      "message": "Ok. Form control is out.\nScript appears in File-New-HTML Document  (but Insert menu is different!)\n\n1. Web/Writer menus are different from Writer menus\n2. But maybe there are not separate webpages for Web/Writer?\n\nWhat to do?\n3.  Seems bad to mention Script in Writer, when it never appear will appear in Writer menu.\n4.  But if not separate Writer/Web pages, then I can add an (for Writer/Web only).\n5.  There are also two controls in Writer/Web Insert that do not appear on this page (Anchors, Date), but I assume it is better to just ignore for now.\n\nIs that a reasonable navigation between rock and hard place?",
