Why?\n\nThe string above contains two verbs, the auxiliary “do” and the main verb “exist”.\n\nBoth strings are in the simple present tense. In this tense, when you have a third-person subject (“The page” in this case — you can replace that with “it”, and that’s how you know it’s 3rd person), you add to the first verb the suffix -s or -es. Thus, “exists”, but “does not exist”, because you only add the ending to the first verb.\n\nI’ll fix it.",
