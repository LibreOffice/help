They can be merged, though, as long as they don\u0027t block *merged* commits. Once you merge one of the non-merged commits theoretically blocking each other, I will fix the other one.\n\nI can\u0027t fix the future (i.e., after the merge) mutual blocking before you merge one of the affected commits.",
