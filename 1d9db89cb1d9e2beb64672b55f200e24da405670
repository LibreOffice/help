      "message": "We have rather strict rules in \u0027core\u0027, regarding what should and what should not go to a patch. E.g., when a patch adds/removes some functionality, no *reformatting* should accompany the change - to allow easily see the changed content. When we need to reformat stuff, those formatting changes go to a separate commit.\n\nBut unfortunately, most changes to \u0027help\u0027 mix unrelated changes in one commit, which makes review an awful process. E.g. here, which lines bear the \"remove obsolete information\"? Which add link to PGP? You can\u0027t easily see with a quick glance on the mix of red and green lines here - you need to inspect everything carefully. Sigh.\n\nThanks anyway!",
