      "message": "Contraposing \"strings\" to \"values\" is wrong. Cells may have different *types* of values; textual values (strings) and numerical values (numbers/dates/booleans) among them. You can write sometimes things like \"numbers or strings\" (not here), or even \"numbers or dates\" (which is intuitively correct, although dates in Calc are also numbers); but not \"values or strings\".\n\nHere simple \"values\" is OK.",

      "message": "I like the existence of the example. It only needs fixing.\n\nThis example is wrong. The formula entered here follows the same \"absolute/relative\" referencing rules (https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/scalc/guide/relativ_absolut_ref.html) used everywhere, e.g. in conditional formats. (Note that in this case, scalar value \"by intersection\" is not applicable.) Specifically, when you select a *range*, the formula you enter corresponds to the *first* (top-left) cell of the selected range. In this case, formula \"ISODD(A1:A4)\" means \"When you enter data into *A1*, accept it if and only if ISODD(\u003cvector of four values starting with this\u003e)\" returns TRUE. But (1) you didn\u0027t want to check the other values (A2-A4) when testing A1, and (2) ISODD gives error when you pass an array to it.\n\nFor experiment, try your suggested formula. Then try entering *anything* into A1 to A4. Then check what you had entered, by selecting *A2* and opening Data-\u003eValidity (this is an important step to understand the concept).\n\nThe correct conditional formula for selection of A1:A4 is ISODD(A1).",
