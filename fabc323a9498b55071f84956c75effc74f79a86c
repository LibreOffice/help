I initially carefully crafted a font fallback that I tested for appearance across browsers and platforms (via the now defunct browsershots service) and has been gradually torn apart. And we don’t use that plagiarized Inter font in our brand, I don‘t know where why it’s popped up.\n\nThe CSS should use a variable to define the fallback list in just one place, instead of hardcoding it again and making it hard to maintain.",
