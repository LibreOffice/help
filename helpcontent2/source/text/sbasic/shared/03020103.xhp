<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3155132" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="6">
<emph>FileName: </emph>Name and path of the file that you wan to open. If you try to read a file that does not exist (Access = Read), an error message appears. If you try to write to a file that does exist (Access = Write), a new file is created.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149262" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="7">
<emph>Mode:</emph> Keyword that specifies the file mode. Valid values: Append (append to sequential file), binary (data can be accessed by bytes using Get and Put), Input (opens data channel for reading), Output (opens data channel for writing), and Random (edits relative files).</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3154014" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="8">
<emph>Access:</emph> Keyword that defines the access type. Valid values: Read (read-only), Write (write-only), Read Write (both).</paragraph>

<emph>Protected:</emph> Keyword that defines the security status of a file after opening. Valid values: Shared (file may be opened by other applications), Lock Read (file is protected against reading), Lock Write (file is protected against writing), Lock Read Write (denies file access).</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153190" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="10">
<emph>FileNumber:</emph> Any integer expression from 0 to 511 to indicate the number of a free data channel. You can then pass commands through the data channel to access the file. The file number must be determined by the FreeFile function immediately before the Open statement.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151115" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="11">
<emph>DatasetLength:</emph> For relative files, returns the length of a certain record. This parameter is only necessary if the file was opened for Random access.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="note" id="par_id3153418" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="12">You can only modify the contents of a file that was opened with the Open statement. If you try to open a file that is already open, an error message appears.</paragraph>
