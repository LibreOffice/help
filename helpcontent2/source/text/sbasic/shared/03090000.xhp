You can also execute certain procedures within the program according to specific conditions, or repeat a section of the program within a sub-procedure or function. You can use loops to repeat parts of a program as many times as necessary, or until a certain condition is met. These type of control statements are classified as Condition, Loop, or Jump statements.</paragraph>
