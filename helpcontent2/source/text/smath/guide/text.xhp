<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id337229" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="NEW">Some text strings get interpreted as operators automatically. Sometimes this is not what you want. If you want to write W<emph>*</emph> (a letter with a superscripted asterisk), the asterisk will be interpreted as a multiplication operator. Enclose the direct text within double quotes or add spaceholders.</paragraph>
