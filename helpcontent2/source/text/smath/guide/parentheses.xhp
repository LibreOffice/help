<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3083281" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="3">You can set individual brackets using "left" and "right", but the distance between the brackets will not be fixed, as they adapt to the argument. Nevertheless, there is a way to display brackets so that the distance between them is fixed. To accomplish this, place a "\" (backslash) before the normal brackets. These brackets now behave like any other symbol and the alignment is the same as with other symbols:</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3155960" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="6">left lbrace x right none</paragraph>
