Think of layers as individual workspaces that you can hide or lock. $[officename] Draw layers do not determine the stacking order of objects on your slide. The stacking order of objects on your slide is determined by the sequence in which you add the objects. The areas on a layer that do not contain objects are transparent.</paragraph>
