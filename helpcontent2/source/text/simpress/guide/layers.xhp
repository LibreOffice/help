Layers allow you to assemble elements on a page that are related. Think of layers as individual workspaces that you can hide or lock. Layers do not determine the stacking order of objects on your slide. The stacking order of objects on your slide is determined by the sequence in which you add the objects. The areas on a layer that do not contain objects are transparent.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="tip" id="par_id3154507" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="2">You can lock a layer to protect its contents, or hide a layer and its contents. When you add a new layer to a page, the layer is added to all of the pages in your document. However, when you add an object to a layer, it is only added to the current page. If you want the object to appear on all of the pages, add the object to the master page (<emph>View - Master</emph>).</paragraph>
