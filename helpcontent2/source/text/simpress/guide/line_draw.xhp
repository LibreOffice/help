Each Bézier curve segment is defined by two data points (endpoints) and one or two control points (handles) that you can drag to adjust the arc of the curve. A control point is connected to a data point by a control line. Moving a control point pulls the curve towards it, and changes the shape of a curve.</paragraph>
