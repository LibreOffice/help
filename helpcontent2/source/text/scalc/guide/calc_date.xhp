The format is set to "General", which causes the result of a calculation containing date entries to be displayed as a date.

The values are calculated as of the exact moment when you entered the last formula and pressed the <item type="keycode">Enter</item> key. This value is not automatically updated, although "Now" continuously changes. In the <emph>Tools</emph> menu, the menu item <emph>Cell Contents - AutoCalculate</emph> is normally active; however, automatic calculation does not apply to the function NOW. This ensures that your computer is not solely occupied with updating the sheet.</paragraph>
