<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3155131" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="3">One use for the <emph>AutoFilter</emph> function is to quickly restrict the display to records with identical entries in a data field.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3146119" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="4">In the <emph>Filter</emph> dialog, you can also define ranges which contain the values in particular data fields. You can use the standard filter to connect up to three conditions with either a logical AND or a logical OR operator.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3150010" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="5">The <emph>Advanced filter</emph> exceeds the three condition limitation and allows up to a total of eight filter conditions. With advanced filters you enter the conditions directly into the sheet.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="note" id="par_idN10663" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="NEW">When you select filtered rows and then either apply formatting, or delete the selected rows, this action then applies only to the filtered rows. The hidden rows are not affected. This is the opposite to rows that you have hidden manually by the <emph>Format - Rows - Hide Rows</emph> command. Manually hidden rows are deleted when you delete a selection that contains them.</paragraph>
