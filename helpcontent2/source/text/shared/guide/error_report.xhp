If the program enters into an endless loop, so that it does not respond to mouse-clicks or keypresses, you can also start the Error Report Tool manually.</paragraph>

Please help us to improve the software and send the generated error report.</paragraph>

For example, if the error only appears after a change in your hardware or software environment, or if you clicked on a button, please include that information.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3159399" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="9">Sending the Error Report</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150504" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="10">The Error Report Tool uses the HTTP PUT / SOAP protocol to send the report data. You may optionally enter some descriptive text that will help us to identify the context of the program crash. Then click the <emph>Send</emph> button.</paragraph>

Mark the check box if you allow to be contacted by e-mail, should additional information be required. By default this box is not marked, so you will not get any e-mail.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3154366" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="14">The error report consists of several files. The main file contains information about the error type, operating system name and version, memory usage, and the description that you entered. You can click the <emph>Show Report</emph> button on the main dialog of the Error Report Tool to view what will get sent in the main file.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151177" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="15">In addition, relevant memory contents and stack traces are gathered by some system standard tools ("dbhhelp.dll" on Windows systems, "pstack" on UNIX systems). This information will be sent also.</paragraph>
