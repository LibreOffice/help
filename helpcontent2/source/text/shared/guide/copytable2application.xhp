<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3145345" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="11">To copy a cell range into a text document, select the cell range in the sheet and then use either the clipboard or drag-and-drop to insert the cells into the text document. You will then find an OLE object in the text document, which you can edit further.</paragraph>

If you drag cells into the outline view, each cell will form a line of the outline view. If you just drag the cells you will move the cells. The cells will only be copied if you press the Shift key when dragging.</paragraph>

They are also copied when you start a drag-and-drop action. However, the objects will be inserted only if you drop them within the same document.</paragraph>
