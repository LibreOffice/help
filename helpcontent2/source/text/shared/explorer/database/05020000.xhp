You can refer to the primary key from other tables to access the data of this table. All data fields referring to this primary key will be identified as an external key.</paragraph>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3147085" l10n="U" xml-lang="en-US" oldref="8">All data fields referring to a primary key will be identified in the table window by a small key symbol.</paragraph>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3152933" l10n="U" xml-lang="en-US" oldref="9">For example, consider the "Item" table, where each individual record can be defined by an item number. The "Item-Number" field is a unique key in this table, and is referred to as a "primary key".</paragraph>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3158410" l10n="U" xml-lang="en-US" oldref="10">There is an additional table with the name "Orders" in the database. The number of the ordered item is assigned to each record in this table through an "Item-Number" field. This field is also a key field. It contains a key used to access the records of another table, in this case the "Item" table. For this reason, this field is referred to as the "foreign key".</paragraph>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151177" l10n="U" xml-lang="en-US" oldref="11">A relation is used to relate the primary key of the "Article" sheet and the other key of the "Orders" sheet.</paragraph>

You can add a relation by using drag-and-drop to drop the field of one table onto the field of the other table. A relation is removed again by selecting it and pressing the Delete key.</paragraph>
  <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" oldref="18" role="paragraph" id="par_id3149984" l10n="U">Alternatively, you can also click the <emph>New Relation</emph> icon in the top area of the relation field and define the relation between two tables in the <link href="text/shared/explorer/database/05020100.xhp" name="Relations"><emph>Relations</emph></link> dialog.</paragraph>

  <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="paragraph" id="par_id3155856" l10n="U" oldref="15">By double-clicking a connection line, you can assign certain properties to the relation. The <emph>Relations </emph>dialog opens.</paragraph>
