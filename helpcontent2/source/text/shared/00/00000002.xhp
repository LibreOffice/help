<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153178" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="66">There are two different types of ImageMaps. A Client Side ImageMap is evaluated on the client computer, which loaded the graphic from the Internet, while a Server Side ImageMap is evaluated on the server computer which provides the <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="HTML">HTML</link> page on the Internet. In server evaluation, clicking an ImageMap sends the relative coordinates of the cursor within the image to the <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="server">server</link>, and a dedicated program on the server responds. In the client evaluation, clicking a defined hotspot of the ImageMap activates the URL, as if it were a normal text link. The URL appears below the mouse pointer when passing across the ImageMap.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150740" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="67">As ImageMaps can be used in different ways, they can be stored in different <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="formats">formats</link>.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153057" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="71">Server Side ImageMaps appear for the reader as a picture or frame on the page. Click on the ImageMap with the mouse, and the coordinates of the relative position are sent to the server. Aided by an extra program, the server then determines the next step to take. There are several incompatible methods to define this process, the two most common being:</paragraph>

You will need to ask your provider or network administrator which type of ImageMaps are supported by the server and how to access the evaluation program.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151290" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="76">Modern Client Side ImageMaps do not present as much difficulty on the server side. The area of the picture or frame in which the reader can click on is indicated by the appearance of the linked <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="URL">URL</link> when the mouse passes over the area. The ImageMap is stored in a layer below the picture and contains information about the referenced regions. The only disadvantage of Client Side ImageMaps is that older Web browsers cannot read them; a disadvantage that will, however, resolve itself in time.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149664" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="77">When saving the ImageMap, select the file type <emph>SIP - StarView ImageMap</emph>. This saves the ImageMap directly in a format which can be applied to every active picture or frame in your document. However, if you just want to use the ImageMap on the current picture or text frame, you do not have to save it in any special format. After defining the regions, simply click <emph>Apply</emph>. Nothing more is necessary. Client Side ImageMaps saved in <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="HTML">HTML</link> format are inserted directly into the page in HTML code.</paragraph>

The four numbers are separated by dots, for example 123.234.56.78. Every user has an Internet protocol (IP) address. The IP address is normally only assigned dynamically for the duration of the connection. Since this type of address is difficult to remember, you usually address Internet <link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="servers">servers</link> by name. The "name server" sees that the name is matched to the correct IP address.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3159125" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="92">Java</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153188" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="93">The Java programming language is a platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (http://www.sun.com) that is especially suited for use in the Internet. Web pages and applications programmed with Java class files can be used on all modern operating systems. Programs using Java programming language are usually developed in a Java development environment and then compiled to a "byte code". A .class file is created, which can then be inserted as a "Java Applet" into HTML pages. Several .class files can be combined to a single .jar or .zip file. A Web browser that supports the Java class files can compile the Java programming language code immediately after receipt without the user having to unpack the archive.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3147418" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="94">The basic concept of the Java technology consists of sending a more advanced level of instruction (for example, "draw a line") to the Web browser which then knows how to execute the instruction on the client computer. Thus a program written in the Java programming language can run on any computer which has an interpreter or compiler for the Java programming language, independent of processor type and operating system.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3147435" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="187">Do not confuse "JavaScript" and "Java Applets". JavaScript is a simple, limited script language for Web browsers used, for example, to display animated text. JavaScript describes objects in a language that looks a bit like the Java programming language and lets users optically enhance their HTML pages. "Java Applets", on the other hand, are programs written in the Java programming language and compiled into byte code, as described in the preceding paragraphs.</paragraph>

For example, if you insert a diagram into your text document,you see icons for editing the diagram, in fact the same ones you see in diagram documents. In this sense, we refer to the diagram document as a plug-in within the text document.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3156737" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="114">Plug-ins, generally speaking, are software additions to particular applications which provide enhanced functionality. Often import and export filters for various file formats are stored as plug-ins in a plug-in directory.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149958" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="115">Netscape web browser extensions produced by Netscape Communication Corporation are also called plug-ins.

Make sure to enter the new installation path (for example,$[officepath]/share/plugin) in <emph>Tools - Options - $[officename] - Paths</emph>. Note: Some plug-ins still require Netscape to be installed before the setup program can be run.</paragraph>

Whenever you access the Internet from a company network and request a Web page that has already been read by a colleague, the proxy will be able to display the page much quicker, as long as it's still in the memory. All that has to be checked in this case is that the page stored in the proxy is the latest version. If this is the case, the page won't have to be downloaded from the much slower Internet but can be loaded directly from the proxy.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3147330" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="230">SGML stands for "Standard Generalized Markup Language". SGML is based on the idea that documents have structural and other semantic elements that can be described without reference to how such elements should be displayed. The actual display of such a document may vary, depending on the output medium and style preferences. In structured texts, SGML not only defines structures (in the DTD = Document Type Definition) but also ensures they are consistently used.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3148747" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="231"><link href="text/shared/00/00000002.xhp" name="HTML">HTML</link> is a specialized application of SGML. This means that most Web browsers support only a limited range of SGML standards and that almost all SGML-enabled systems can produce attractive HTML pages. The first line of an HTML document invariably contains an SGML instruction that defines all following lines as belonging to an HTML subset.</paragraph>
