<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id4814294" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">If you like it that $[officename] automatically completes the words that you frequently use, you can make further adjustments to refine that behavior. If you want, you can also save the current list of collected words so that it can be used in the next session. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id2593462" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">To fine-tune the word completion choose <item type="menuitem">Tools â€“ AutoCorrect Options - Word Completion</item> and select any of the following options: </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN107C6" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW"> To Insert an Additional Space Character </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B03" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW"> Select <emph>Append space</emph>. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B0E" role="note" l10n="NEW"> The space character is appended after you type the first character of the next word after the auto-completed word. The space character is suppressed if the next character is a delimiter, such as a full stop or a new line character. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN107CC" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW"> To Define the Accept Key </paragraph>

      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN107D2" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW"> To Select the Minimum Number of Characters </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B36" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW"> Use the <emph>Min. word length</emph> box to set the minimum number of characters a word must have to be collected into the list. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN107D8" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW"> To Select the Scope of Collected Words </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B4C" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW"> Select <emph>When closing a document, save the list for later use in other documents</emph>. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B53" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW"> Now the list is also valid for other documents that you open. When you close the last %PRODUCTNAME document, the word list is deleted.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B56" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW"> If you do not select the checkbox, the list is only valid as long as the current document is open. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id2634968" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">If you want the word list to exist longer than the current %PRODUCTNAME session, save it as a document, as described in the following section.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN107DE" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW"> To Use the Word List for Further Sessions</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10B94" role="note" l10n="NEW"> If the automatic spellcheck option is enabled, only the words that are recognized by the spellcheck are collected. </paragraph>
