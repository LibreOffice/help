      "message": "Some remarks\n1) You may appreciate the Help editor we have at \nhttps://newdesign.libreoffice.org/xhpeditor/index.php\nInstructions for the editor are in the wiki:\nhttps://wiki.documentfoundation.org/DocumentationHelpEditor\n(the Help editor is cloneable from the tools-dev repo at\nhttps://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/dev-tools/tree/help3/xhpeditor)\n\n2) There seems to have some repetitions in the How-to-get sections. It may be interesting to refactor later in embedable chunks from the /00/ folder of the module.\n",

      "message": "1) The method I use is to edit in Eclipse and regularly paste the entire file into the Help editor to check against the DTD and confirm the rendering, and also to generate unique ids.\n\n2) There are no chunks in the /00/ folder to use in this case. Part of the problem is that these pages consolidate formerly separate pages. That was necessary because those pages included bookmarks with the same \"hid\" string and this is part of the issue that I\u0027m resolving with this change. I\u0027ve counted 152 other cases were this problem exists throughout the help pages. It is causing incorrect pages to be presented because these copies of hid keys generate duplicate entries in the hid2page.js mapping and it appears the last entry in the map masks any earlier associations.\n\nI also found that it\u0027s not possible to \u003cembed\u003e when the source is in the same file. I did therefore consider creating a file that is purely there to hold embedable blocks but for just this one case it would have only tended to clutter.",
