Something like: \"If, for example, a Character Style \u0027Emphasis\u0027 highlights a word with a yellow background, and the user mistakenly \u0027removed\u0027 it by using a white background, the \u0027Yellow\u0027 attribute would be greyed-out and \u0027White\u0027 listed under Direct Formatting. The Styles Inspector shows only those attributes that diverge from the parent (which is usually the Default Paragraph Style).\" But you are the documentation expert.",
