These are all listed in a selection window, in which you can click the required element with the mouse to insert the object into your work. There is an exhaustive <link href="text/smath/01/03091500.xhp" name="reference">reference</link> list and numerous <link href="text/smath/01/03090900.xhp" name="samples">samples</link> contained in the Help.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3150207" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="10">Creating a Formula</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3145386" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="12">As with charts and images, formulas are created as objects within a document. Inserting a formula into a document automatically starts $[officename] Math. You can create, edit and format the formula using a large selection of predefined symbols and functions.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3153916" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="15">Typing a Formula Directly</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150213" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="13">If you are familiar with the $[officename] Math language, you can also type a formula directly into the document. For example, type this formula into a text document: "a sup 2 + b sup 2 = c sup 2". Select this text and choose <emph>Insert - Object - Formula</emph>. The text will be converted into a formatted formula.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="note" id="par_id3146325" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="14">Formulas cannot be calculated in $[officename] Math because it is a formula editor (for writing and showing formulas) and not a calculation program. Use spreadsheets to calculate formulas, or for simple calculations use the text document calculation function.</paragraph>

You can add new symbols to the basic catalog of $[officename] Math symbols, or create your own special catalogs. Numerous special characters are also available.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3148392" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="18">Formulas in Context</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3148774" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="8">To make working with formulas easier, use the context menus, which can be called up with a right mouse click. This applies especially to the Commands window. This context menu contains all the commands that are found in the Elements window, and also operators, and so on, which can be inserted into your formula by mouse-click without having to key them into the Commands window.</paragraph>
