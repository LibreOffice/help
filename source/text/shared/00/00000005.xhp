   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3155922" role="paragraph">Abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is a character set for displaying fonts on personal computers. It consists of 128 characters including letters, numbers, punctuation and symbols.

   <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id431619103899855">A style is a set of formatting attributes, grouped and identified by a name (the style name). When you apply a style to an object, the object is formatted with the set of attributes of the style. Several objects of same nature can have the same style. As consequence, when you change the set of formatting attributes of the style, all objects associated with the style also change their formatting attributes accordingly. Use styles to uniformly format a large set of paragraphs, cells, and objects and better manage the formatting of documents.</paragraph>
   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3159254" role="paragraph">When you do not use styles, and apply formatting attributes to parts of text directly, this is called Direct formatting (also called manual formatting). The formatting is applied only to the selected area of the document. If the document has several paragraphs, frames, or any other object, you apply direct formatting on each object. Direct formatting is available with the Format menu and with the Formatting toolbar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id971619105747398">A direct formatting attribute applied on a object overrides the corresponding attribute of the style applied to the object.</paragraph>

    <h2 xml-lang="en-US" id="hd_id871622865956807">Half-width and Full-width Characters</h2>
    <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="paragraph" id="par_id381622866004346">Half-width and full-width are properties used to differentiate characters used by some East Asian languages and scripts, mainly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).</paragraph>
    <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="paragraph" id="par_id171622867006461">The Han characters, Hiragana and Katakana characters, as well as Hangul characters used by these scripts are usually of square shape, and on fixed-width (monospace) display they occupy space of two Latin/ASCII characters. They are therefore called full-width characters, while the letters in Latin alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks included in ASCII character set are called half-width characters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="paragraph" id="par_id871622874043146">For historical reasons, a set of square-shaped Latin letters, digits, and punctuation marks are also defined and used in CJK typography, in addition to or in place of their half-width counterparts. They are called full-width forms. Similarly, there are also half-width forms of the usually full-width Katakanas and Hangul Jamos, and they have narrower shapes instead of square ones. A character's half-width and full-width forms are essentially two ways of writing the same character, just like uppercase and lowercase forms of Latin alphabet. $[officename] supports conversion between half-width and full-width, as well as ignoring width difference when matching text strings.</paragraph>

This is important if you want to make the document available to other computers that may have a completely different directory structure, drive or volume names. It is also recommended to save relatively if you want to create a directory structure on an Internet server.</paragraph>
   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3148927" role="paragraph">If you prefer absolute saving, all references to other files will also be defined as absolute, based on the respective drive, volume or root directory.

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3159239" role="paragraph">An SQL database is a database system which offers an <link href="text/shared/00/00000005.xhp#sql">SQL</link> interface. SQL databases are often used in client/server networks in which different clients access a central server (for example, an SQL server), hence they are also called SQL server databases, or SQL servers for short.</paragraph>

Access is achieved through <link href="text/shared/00/00000005.xhp#odbc">ODBC</link>, JDBC, or a native driver integrated into $[officename].</paragraph>

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3149448" role="paragraph">Widows and orphans are historical typography terms, which have been in use for many years. A widow refers to a short line at the end of a paragraph, which when printed, appears alone at the top of the next page. An orphan is, in contrast, the first line of a paragraph printed alone at the bottom of the previous page. In a $[officename] text document you can automatically prevent such occurrences in the desired Paragraph Style. When doing so, you can determine the minimum amount of lines to be kept together on a page.</paragraph>
