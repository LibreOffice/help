   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3155922" role="paragraph">Abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is a character set for displaying fonts on personal computers. It consists of 128 characters including letters, numbers, punctuation and symbols. The extended ASCII character set contains 256 characters. Each character has been assigned a unique number, also referred to as ASCII Code.</paragraph>
   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3150823" role="paragraph">In HTML pages, only characters from the 7 Bit ASCII character set should appear. Other characters, such as German umlauts, are distinguished by way of a separate code.

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3159254" role="paragraph">If you format a document without Styles, it is referred to as "direct" formatting. This means modifying text or other objects, such as frames or tables, by applying various attributes directly. The format applies only to the selected area and all changes must be made separately. Styles, on the other hand, are not applied to the text directly, but rather are defined in the Styles window and then applied. One advantage is that when you change a Style, all parts of the document to which that Style is assigned are modified at the same time.</paragraph>
   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3147287" role="paragraph">You can remove direct formatting from your document by selecting the entire text with the shortcut keys <switchinline select="sys"><caseinline select="MAC"><keycode>Command</keycode></caseinline><defaultinline><keycode>Ctrl</keycode></defaultinline></switchinline><keycode>+A</keycode> and then choosing <menuitem>Format - Clear Direct Formatting</menuitem>.</paragraph>

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3154255" role="paragraph">A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database.

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3145230" role="paragraph">In %PRODUCTNAME, the register-true feature is called <emph>Page line-spacing</emph>.</paragraph>
     <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3154223" role="paragraph">Page line-spacing refers to the coincident imprint of the lines within a type area on the front and the back side of a page. The page line-spacing feature makes a page easier to read by preventing gray shadows from shining through between the lines of text. The page line-spacing term also refers to lines in adjacent text columns, where lines in different columns use the same vertical grid, thereby aligning them vertically with each other.</paragraph>
     <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id761604345191168">Page line-spacing printing is particularly useful for documents that will have two pages set next to each other (for example, in a book or brochure), for multi-column layouts, and for documents intended for double-sided printing.</paragraph>

   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3152946" role="paragraph">If you choose to save relatively, the references to embedded graphics or other objects in your document will be saved relative to the location in the file system. In this case, it does not matter where the referenced directory structure is recorded. The files will be found regardless of location, as long as the reference remains on the same drive or volume. This is important if you want to make the document available to other computers that may have a completely different directory structure, drive or volume names. It is also recommended to save relatively if you want to create a directory structure on an Internet server.</paragraph>
   <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3148927" role="paragraph">If you prefer absolute saving, all references to other files will also be defined as absolute, based on the respective drive, volume or root directory.
