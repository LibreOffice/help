The frame indicates the amount by which the corners are rounded. When the frame is positioned at the top left corner, no rounding occurs. When the frame is positioned on the handle centered at the top of the object, the corners are rounded as much as possible. You adjust the degree of rounding by moving the frame between these two positions.</paragraph>
