<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3154823" xml-lang="en-US">All contents of the Navigator window are referred to here as "categories," whether headings, sheets, tables, frames, graphics, OLE objects, sections, hyperlinks, references, indexes, comments, or drawing objects.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153662" xml-lang="en-US">The Navigator displays types of objects contained in a document. If a plus sign appears next to a category, this indicates that at least one object of this kind exists. If you rest the mouse pointer on the category name, the number of objects is displayed in an extended tip.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3146797" xml-lang="en-US">Open a category by clicking on the plus sign. If you only want to view the entries in a certain category, select the category and click the <emph>Content Navigation View</emph> icon. Until you click the icon again, only the objects of this category will be displayed.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3166461" xml-lang="en-US">You may dock the Navigator to any document border or turn it back into a free window (double click on the gray area). You can change the size of the Navigator when it is a free window.</paragraph>
