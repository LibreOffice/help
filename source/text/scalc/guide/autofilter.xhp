So don't use the word "hidden" when a filter is applied.</comment>. You can see if rows have been filtered from the discontinuous row numbers. The column that has been used for the filter is identified by a different color for the arrow button.</paragraph>
      <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id931752683152912">When no cell range is selected, the AutoFilter will apply to the column up to the first empty cell. Please ensure that you select the appropriate range before applying the AutoFilter.</paragraph>
      <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id301752683274133">When the cell range is expanded to include additional non-empty cells, the AutoFilter automatically adjusts the filter range to encompass these new cells.</paragraph>
      <paragraph id="par_id9216589" role="paragraph">When you apply an additional AutoFilter on another column of a filtered data range, then the other combo boxes list only the filtered data.</paragraph>

If you choose <emph>Standard</emph>, the <item type="menuitem">Standard Filter</item> dialog appears, allowing you to set up a standard filter. Choose "Top 10" to display the highest 10 values only. </paragraph>

      <warning id="par_id3159236">The arithmetic functions also take account of the cells that are not visible due to an applied filter. For example, a sum of an entire column will also total the values in the filtered cells. Apply the <link href="text/scalc/01/04060106.xhp">SUBTOTAL</link> function if only the cells visible after the application of a filter are to be taken into account.</warning>
