<list type="unordered">
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3155133" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="42">Enter "0 1/5" in a cell (without the quotation marks) and press the input key. In the input line above the spreadsheet you will see the value 0.2, which is used for the calculation.</paragraph>
</listitem>
</list>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3145750" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="43">If you enter "0 1/2" AutoCorrect causes the three characters 1, / and 2 to be replaced by a single character. The same applies to 1/4 and 3/4. This replacement is defined in <emph>Tools - AutoCorrect Options - Options</emph> tab.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3145367" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="44">If you want to see multi-digit fractions such as "1/10", you must change the cell format to the multi-digit fraction view. Open the context menu of the cell, and choose <emph>Format cells. </emph>Select "Fraction" from the <emph>Category</emph> field, and then select "-1234 10/81". You can then enter fractions such as 12/31 or 12/32 - the fractions are, however, automatically reduced, so that in the last example you would see 3/8.</paragraph>
