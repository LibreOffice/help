<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id315002" role="paragraph">When you insert an image in Calc, it gets anchored to the cell by default and does not resize when moved.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id741607810664944">
The image could be anchored in three different ways:
</paragraph>
  <list type="unordered" >
    <listitem>
     <paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id351607809926451"><emph>To Cell:</emph> When the image is anchored to cell, the image will move along with the cell( while copying, sorting or inserting cells).</paragraph>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id871607809971823"><emph>To Cell(resize with cell):</emph> When resize with cell option is selected, the image would move along with the cell. Also the size of the image will be altered according to the size of the destination cell. The aspect ratio of original image is maintained as long as the image fits into the cell. </paragraph>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id551607810008215"><emph>To Page:</emph> When the image is anchored to page, ordering of cells or pasting in other cells do not affect the image position in the page.</paragraph>
    </listitem>
  </list>
  
  
  <h2 id="hd_id151607809776222">To Change the anchor of an image</h2>   <emph>Insert Image Dialog - Anchor.</emph> Or,
    on the context menu of the image choose -<emph> Anchor</emph>

  <tip id="par_id761607809520625"> The original size of the image and cell is preserved while pasting the entire row or entire column for both "To Cell" and "To Cell(resize with cell)" option.</tip>
