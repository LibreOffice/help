The image could be anchored in three different ways:
</paragraph>
  <list type="unordered" >
    <listitem>
     <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="listitem" id="par_id351607809926451"><emph>To Cell:</emph> When the image is anchored to cell, the image will move along with the cell( while copying, sorting or inserting cells).</paragraph>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="listitem" id="par_id871607809971823"><emph>To Cell(resize with cell):</emph> When resize with cell option is selected, the image would move along with the cell. Also the size of the image will be altered according to the size of the destination cell. The aspect ratio of original image is maintained as long as the image fits into the cell. </paragraph>

    <listitem><paragraph xml-lang="en-US" role="listitem" id="par_id551607810008215"><emph>To Page:</emph> When the image is anchored to page, ordering of cells or pasting in other cells do not affect the image position in the page.</paragraph>
