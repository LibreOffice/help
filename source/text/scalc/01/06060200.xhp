<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153188">The structure of protected spreadsheet documents can be changed only if the <emph>Protect</emph> option is disabled. On the context menus for the spreadsheet tabs at the lower graphic border, only the menu item <emph>Select All Sheets</emph> can be activated. All other menu items are deactivated. To remove the protection, call up the command <emph>Tools - Protect Spreadsheet Structure</emph> again. If no password is assigned, protection is immediately removed. If you were assigned a password, the <emph>Remove Spreadsheet Protection</emph> dialog appears, in which you must enter the password. Only then can you remove the check mark specifying that protection is active.</paragraph>
