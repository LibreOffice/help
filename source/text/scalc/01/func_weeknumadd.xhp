Use the <link href="text/scalc/01/func_weeknum.xhp">WEEKNUM</link> function for ODF OpenFormula and Excel 2010 compatibility, or <link href="text/scalc/01/func_isoweeknum.xhp">ISOWEEKNUM</link> function when you just need ISO 8601 week numbers. In releases prior to $[officename] 5.1 WEEKNUM_EXCEL2003 was named WEEKNUM_ADD.</paragraph>
