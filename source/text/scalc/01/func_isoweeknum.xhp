<note id="par_idN105E4">The International Standard ISO 8601 has decreed that Monday shall be the first day of the week. A week that lies partly in one year and partly in another is assigned a number in the year in which most of its days lie. That means that week number 1 of any year is the week that contains the January 4th.</note>
