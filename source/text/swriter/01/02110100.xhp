  <tip id="par_id3149968">You can configure $[officename] according to your specific preferences for navigating within a document. To do this, choose <link href="text/shared/01/06140000.xhp"><emph>Tools - Customize</emph></link>. The various tables for adapting <link href="text/shared/01/06140100.xhp">menus</link>, <link href="text/shared/01/06140200.xhp">keyboard input</link> or toolbars contain various functions for navigation within the document under the "Navigate" category. For example, you can add buttons to a toolbar to jump to the index tags in the document with the "Go to Next/Previous Index Entry" commands.</tip>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3154330">The available categories largely correspond to those in the <link href="text/swriter/01/02110000.xhp">Navigator</link> selection box. However, you can select other jump destinations that are not classic Navigator categories: for example, Reminders, Repeat Search or Recency.</paragraph>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id561713406417133">Select from one of the following options: Bookmarks, Comments, Controls, Drawing objects, Fields by type, Fields, Footnotes, Frames, Headings, Images, Indexes, OLE objects, Page, Recency, Reminder, Repeat search, Sections, Selection, Table formula, Tables, Wrong table formula.</paragraph>

  <h2 id="hd_id1001713405229169">Footnotes</h2>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id541713405238672">Select the <emph>Footnotes</emph> category to jump between footnotes and endnotes. This can be used in conjunction with the <emph>Anchor â†” Text</emph> button in the Navigator, to quickly jump between the text of the footnote/endnote and its anchor in the body.</paragraph>

  <h2 id="hd_id801713406561353">Recency</h2>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id141713406574059">When selecting the <emph>Recency</emph> category, the <emph>Go back</emph> and <emph>Go forward</emph> buttons can be used to jump to recent cursor positions in the document.</paragraph>

  <h2 id="hd_id701713405928808">Reminders</h2>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id871713405938067">Up to 5 <emph>Reminders</emph> (which are not saved when the document is closed) can be set at various locations in the document. Set a reminder with the <emph>Set Reminders</emph> button in the Navigator.</paragraph>

  <h2 id="hd_id3155338">Repeat Search</h2>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3155361">With the <menuitem>Repeat search</menuitem> category, you can repeat a search you started with the <emph>Search and Replace</emph> dialog or the <emph>Find</emph> toolbar.

  <h2 id="hd_id731713403460395">Table Formulas</h2>
  <paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3148783">For table formulas, you can either jump to all table formulas located within your document with <emph>Table formula</emph> or only to the incorrect ones with <emph>Wrong table formula</emph>. For incorrect formulas, you jump only to formulas that have resulted in errors. The program skips over formulas with resulting errors (those that reference incorrect formulas).</paragraph>
