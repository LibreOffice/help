<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151391">Conditional styles are paragraph styles that have different properties depending on the context. Once defined, you cannot change the conditional properties of a conditional style.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149349">$[officename] applies the paragraph properties of conditional styles as follows (the bold terms correspond to the titles of dialog fields): If a paragraph formatted with a conditional style is in a <emph>Context</emph> that has an <emph>Applied Style</emph> linked to it, then the <emph>Paragraph Style</emph> from that condition is used. If no style is linked to the <emph>Context</emph>, then the attributes defined in the conditional style apply. The following example illustrates this relationship:</paragraph>
<list type="ordered">
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3149883">Open a blank text document and write a short business letter with a header (<emph>Format - Page Style - Header</emph>).</paragraph>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3148768">Define a new Paragraph Style by choosing <emph>New</emph> in the <emph>Styles</emph> window, and selecting all the paragraph properties that you want for your business letter in the <emph>Paragraph Style</emph> dialog. Name this style "Business letter".</paragraph>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3153723">Then click the <emph>Condition</emph> tab and select the <emph>Conditional style</emph> field to define the new Paragraph Style as a conditional style.</paragraph>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3154647">In <emph>Context</emph>, select the header entry and under <emph>Paragraph Styles</emph> select the style for the header in your business letter; for example, the default Paragraph Style "Header". You also can select your own style.</paragraph>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3150760">You can apply the Paragraph Style to the context by double-clicking the selected entry in the <emph>Paragraph Styles</emph> list box or by using <emph>Apply</emph>.</paragraph>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<paragraph role="listitem" id="par_id3149753">Click <emph>OK</emph> to close the Paragraph Style dialog, and then format all paragraphs in your business letter, including the header, with the new "Business letter" conditional Paragraph Style. (When you click in the header, you may need to display <item type="literal">All Styles</item> or <item type="literal">Custom Styles</item> in the style list to use the new business letter style.)</paragraph>
</listitem>
</list>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3145412">The header text now has the attributes you specified in the Header Paragraph Style, while the other parts of the document have the attributes defined in the business letter conditional Paragraph Style.</paragraph>
<tip id="par_id3154473">The <emph>Body Text</emph> style was created as a conditional style. Therefore, any styles you derive from it can be used as conditional styles.</tip>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151321">The Paragraph Style applied to the context is used when exporting to other formats (RTF, HTML, and so on).</paragraph>
