<paragraph id="par_id3156344" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">Calculates a serial time value for the specified hour, minute, and second parameters that are passed as numeric value. You can then use this value to calculate the difference between times.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="hd_id3154124" role="heading" level="2" xml-lang="en-US">Parameters:</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3153193" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US"> <emph>hour:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the hour of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. Valid values: 0-23.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3159252" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US"> <emph>minute:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the minute of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. In general, use values between 0 and 59. However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number of minutes influence the hour value.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3161831" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US"> <emph>second:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the second of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. In general, you can use values between 0 and 59. However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number seconds influences the minute value.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3155854" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US"> <emph>Examples:</emph> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3153952" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">12, -5, 45 corresponds to 11, 55, 45</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3147349" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">12, 61, 45 corresponds to 13, 2, 45</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3147426" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">12, 20, -2 corresponds to 12, 19, 58</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3153365" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">12, 20, 63 corresponds to 12, 21, 4</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3146985" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">You can use the TimeSerial function to convert any time into a single value that you can use to calculate time differences.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3155308" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">The TimeSerial function returns the type Variant with VarType 7 (Date). This value is stored internally as a double-precision number between 0 and 0.9999999999. As opposed to the DateSerial or DateValue function, where the serial date values are calculated as days relative to a fixed date, you can calculate with values returned by the TimeSerial function, but you cannot evaluate them.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id3149482" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">In the TimeValue function, you can pass a string as a parameter containing the time. For the TimeSerial function, however, you can pass the individual parameters (hour, minute, second) as separate numeric expressions.</paragraph>
