The documentation is really important, and documenting anything is a binding contract.",

      "message": "That is a balance/trade-off. \n\nLibreOffice Comm\u0027ty first actions were to abolish feature specification that exist at SUN times, that had a lengthy and complete description of all to be implemented including doc (SW eng\u0027ing best practices). \"Liberate dev\u0027s!!, Freedom to code!!\" was the motto.\n\nThen LO dev\u0027s started to write code like hell and implement features with no doc. Things were worsened by junior devs and casual devs comming and going.\n\nTo a point nobody really knew what the feature was about, except who wrote it and are now gone.\n\nSo yes, doc is a binding contract that help users/devs/QA to write regression tickets \nand should be the most accurate possible.",

This change was adding stuff. It\u0027s OK when it is based on (a) some existing documentation in LO; (2) some existing documentation in ICU (because we use their regex documentation); (3) some discussion.\n\nBut then the text of the problematic line starts with explicit:\n\n\u003e Note that currently all named character class terms, [:alpha:] through [:upper:], must be enclosed in parentheses when used in a regular expression\n\nThe text *explicitly* tells that something is strange, *temporary* (note the \"currently\"), and then the question is: *why*, based on what, it *such* a text gets added at all - and then no one even tries to add someone - erAck for instance, to clarify why does that happen. This is *very* wrong. I would be worried if this was added in \"innocent\" way, but when it\u0027s added like this - knowing that the author is describing some strange thing - it is totally wrong.",
