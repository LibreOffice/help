      "message": "@Rafael -- a new version\n\n@Ming -- do not worry about all these details in the page editing. Rather my reason for contacting you is a concern about whether there is a need for a section about how these settings work for a vertical writing mode. Probably the labels Vertical and Horizontal are exchanged. And maybe there are problems (either with the interface or the help) -- it is often hard to tell.  Maybe we cannot solve/address all the problems at once -- but maybe we can take a step in the right direction (and write BZ tickets for the rest...). Thanks.",
