In general, try to keep the number of notes/warning down, and\n  2.  make them for things that are important to many/most users\n  3.  in this case, it refers to only one condition among eight,\n  4.  which may not even be used in many cases, \n  5.  therefore, does not seem worthy for special attention.\n\nBut -- willing to reconsider -- given that my knowledge about the frequency\nof use of this control is limited.  \n\nI could see there was a \"bug\" report -- but \"one butterfly does not make a summer\",\ni.e., no point in drawing attention to a limitation that only is relevant to a few\npeople in a few cases.\n\nDo many people use over 255 characters in the List?  Is this a common problem?  Then\na note would seem appropriate.  If it is a more specialized (rare) situation, then\nhaving documentation for \"List\" seems better.\n\nI could appreciate that one might \"overlook\" this information.  Could put \"Excel format\" in bold, which could serve to \"catch the eye\".  What do you think?",
