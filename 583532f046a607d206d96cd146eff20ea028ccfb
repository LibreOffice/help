In general, try to keep the number of notes/warning down, and\n  2.  make them for things that are important to many/most users\n  3.  in this case, it refers to only one condition among eight,\n  4.  which may not even be used in many cases, \n  5.  therefore, does not seem worthy for special attention.\n\nBut -- willing to reconsider -- given that my knowledge about the frequency\nof use of this control is limited.  \n\nI could see there was a \"bug\" report -- but \"one butterfly does not make a summer\",\ni.e., no point in drawing attention to a limitation that only is relevant to a few\npeople in a few cases.\n\nDo many people use over 255 characters in the List?  Is this a common problem?  Then\na note would seem appropriate.  If it is a more specialized (rare) situation, then\nhaving documentation for \"List\" seems better.\n\nI could appreciate that one might \"overlook\" this information.  Could put \"Excel format\" in bold, which could serve to \"catch the eye\".  What do you think?",

      "message": "My reasoning is this.\n\nIn MS implementation, the limitation of the list makes it only usable when you put *formulas* there, which would make arbitrary-length lists using no more than 255 characters. In LibreOffice, the unlimited field allows one to put literal lists right here -\u003e literal lists *easily* get longer than 255 characters. So the workflow that is *encouraged* in LibreOffice (I mean encouraged not by someone specifically, but by mere fact of the feature working), is largely incompatible with MS formats.\n\nThe \"note/warning\" is also good IMO because it\u0027s not something *about the discussed field* itself, but rather a related note. I feel it wrong to discuss something related to import/export filters inline with some semantical discussion of a function dialog ...\n\n\nbut as said, not something that I would insist on.",
