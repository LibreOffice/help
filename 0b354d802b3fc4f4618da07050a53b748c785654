      "message": "I\u0027m approving almost blindly but not submitting it...\n\n1) when changing contents in a Help page, avoid refactoring all the lines because the change is swamped in the middle of the refactored lines and no way to clearly see the contents fixes. Refactor is OK a priori: refactor first, submit patch indicating  no change in contents, then create the patch for the fix and submit. This way, the real change is higlighted and reviewers can focus on the change.\n\n2) Screenhots should be localized. Because there is no easy way to produce all localized screenshots, I have discontined to add screenshots in Help pages (\"make screenshots\" is broken in the build). \n\n3) Also, screenshots are collected in \n\nhelpcontent2/source/text/shared/06\n\nso it can be updated in one place and embedded in many other places. There is a logic for the localized images. The localized images must be uploaded and must exist (this means ~70 images to upload in the patch)\n\nA subsequent patch is necessary or a change in this one. Because of the screenshot complexity, I advise to drop it in the meantime.\n\n",
