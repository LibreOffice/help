      "message": "\u003e Can we be a more concise?\n   Always worthwhile to try.\n\n\"Set the values in current tab to the values of the parent style. If the parent style is \"none\", the values of the current tab are [removed from the style / set to default values].\"\n\nQuestions. \n1. How will a person know the meaning of “parent style”? \n\nIf there was a glossary entry, then \u003clink\u003eparent style\u003c/link\u003e would be fine.\nMeanwhile, from search in help for “parent style” or “inherit From”. I only find: https://help.libreoffice.org/7.2/en-US/text/shared/01/05040100.html, which is insufficient at present. \nMy quick-and-dirty “solution” was to point a person to the right place to look.\n\n2. (for the none case) \n(same problem again with referring to “parent style” )\n\n\u003e \"the values of the current tab are [removed from the style \"\n  There are always values so “removed” is not accurate.\n\n\u003e \"the values of the current tab are set to default values\"\n   Some of the tabs have many attributes that can be set, \n   how will a person know which values will be reset?  \n   How will a person find the default values?",
