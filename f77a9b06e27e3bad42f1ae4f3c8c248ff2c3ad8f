      "message": "\u003e Can we be a more concise?\n   Always worthwhile to try.\n\n\"Set the values in current tab to the values of the parent style. If the parent style is \"none\", the values of the current tab are [removed from the style / set to default values].\"\n\nQuestions. \n1. How will a person know the meaning of “parent style”? \n\nIf there was a glossary entry, then \u003clink\u003eparent style\u003c/link\u003e would be fine.\nMeanwhile, from search in help for “parent style” or “inherit From”. I only find: https://help.libreoffice.org/7.2/en-US/text/shared/01/05040100.html, which is insufficient at present. \nMy quick-and-dirty “solution” was to point a person to the right place to look.\n\n2. (for the none case) \n(same problem again with referring to “parent style” )\n\n\u003e \"the values of the current tab are [removed from the style \"\n  There are always values so “removed” is not accurate.\n\n\u003e \"the values of the current tab are set to default values\"\n   Some of the tabs have many attributes that can be set, \n   how will a person know which values will be reset?  \n   How will a person find the default values?",

      "message": "\"Set the values in current tab to the values of the parent style. If the parent style is \"none\", the values of the current tab are [removed from the style / set to default values].\"\n\nThe terms \"Set the values in current tab\" and \"set to default values\" do not describe what happens. \"Setting a value in a field\" means, that this property is added to the set of properties in the style. But the button actually works the opposite, it removes a property from the style.\n\n\"to the values of the parent style\" can easily be wrongly understood as \"copying the value from the parent style\".\n\n\"If the parent style is \"none\" is wrong; the button removes the property from the style regardless of whether there exists a parent or not\".\n\nPerhaps: \"Removes all properties of the current tab from the style. The fields show inherited values or defaults then.\"\n\n(The fact, that the field shows always a value and the user cannot see the origin of that value, is a different problem.)",

      "message": "How to make/get a decision here so that other things can move forward?\n\nProposed decision criterion: \n  From the provided description, a help page reader can form a fairly concrete image of the practical consequences of pressing the button.\n\n@Regina thanks for your reflections (once again) on this challenging problem.\nHave shortened and modified your interesting proposal to: \n \"Resets all modified settings of the current tab to inherited values or defaults\" \n\nTechnically accurate (I think). But will it be helpful for most users? \nI think they will ask where the inherited values and defaults come from, and how to know what is modified. They only learn that something is reset (which is also the button label), without really knowing the consequences.\n\n[ About \"remove\", no dispute with your technical description, but in this context, if the criterion is “practical consequences”, not technical process by which those consequences were achieved, then \"remove\" is not necessary.  As an analogy, we see (and say) the practical consequence that “the sun rises” and do not care about (or mention) the underlying process that \"the earth is rotating\". ]",
